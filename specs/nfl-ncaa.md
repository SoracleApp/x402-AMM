## NFL

Sport ID: 2
Notes

-   Games can tie/draw.
    This is bundled into the No Contest outcome so half-points aren't used for spread and over-under.
    This only affects the contacts; the adapter can just pass along scores.

Run two cron jobs: creation and resolution.

These are the values to get from the API.

### Market Creation

This cron job runs at least once per day.

Get every event matching these criteria:

1.  Occurs no more than 7 days in the future.
2.  Occurs at least one day in the future.
3.  Its moneylineHome, moneylineAway, homeSpread, and toalScore lines have values that are NOT `0.0001`.
4.  Its eventStatusDetails is NOT `"TBD"`.
5.  Neither homeTeamId nor awayTeamId are the TBD team, which is the team with id `2756`.
6.  The event has not already been used to create markets.

Then for each remaining event, make this call:

    contract.createMarket(
      eventId,
      homeTeamId,
      awayTeamId,
      startTimestamp,
      moneylineHome,
      moneylineAway,
      homeSpread,
      totalScore,
    )

### Market Resolution

This cron job runs every two hours.

1.  Get the list of potentially resolvable events from the contract:
    
        contract.listResolvableEvents()
2.  Query the API for each event.
3.  Filter out events whose eventStatus is `STATUS_SCHEDULED`.
4.  For each remaining event, make this call:
    
        contract.trustedResolveMarkets(
          eventId,
          eventStatus,
          homeScore,
          awayScore
        )

## NCAA Football

Sport ID: 1

From the perspective of the adapter, the spec for NCAA Football is *exactly* the same as for the NFL except for the Sport ID.
The contracts however must ensure that there are half-points for spread and over-under.
