## MMA / UFC
Sport ID: 7
Notes
- The fighter IDs are sent in resolution because if a fighter is substituted, the market resolves as No Contest.
- MMA has only Head-to-Head markets.
- There's no score, just a winner.
- Fighter name and ID are given. Name is used for TBD check but mostly for UI.
  ID is used for resolution since it won't ever be duplicated.
- If multiple leagues for MMA are availble, currently filter only for `UFC`
 
Run two cron jobs: creation and resolution.
 
These are the values to get from the API.

### Market Creation
This cron job runs at least once per day.
 
Get every event matching these criteria:
1. Occurs no more than 7 days in the future.
2. Occurs at least one day in the future.
3. Its moneylineHome and moneylineAway lines have values that are NOT `0.0001`.
4. Its eventStatusDetails is NOT `"TBD"`.
5. Neither homeFighter nor awayFighter are the TBD fighter, which is the fighter with name `Opponent TBA`.
6. The event has not already been used to create markets.

Then for each remaining event, make this call:

```typescript
contract.createMarket(
  eventId,
  homeFighterName,
  homeFighterId,
  awayFighterName,
  awayFighterId,
  startTimestamp,
  moneylineHome,
  moneylineAway
)
```

### Market Resolution
This cron job runs every two hours.

1. Get the list of potentially resolvable events from the contract:

   CreateEvent
   ```typescript
   contract.listResolvableEvents()
   ```
2. Query the API for each event.
3. Filter out events whose eventStatus is `STATUS_SCHEDULED`.
4. Calculate `whoWon` like so:
   - If `event.score.winner_home` is true then it is `1` to indicate that Home won.
   - If `event.score.winner_away` is true then it is `2` to indicate that Away won.
   - If neither is true then it is `3` to indicate a draw / tie.
5. For each remaining event, make this call:

   ```typescript
   contract.trustedResolveMarkets(
     eventId,
     eventStatus,
     homeFighterId,
     awayFighterId,
     whoWon
   )
   ```
